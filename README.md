**DESCRIPTION**

**Introduction**

In today's interconnected world, accessing real-time data from the internet is a vital aspect of building dynamic and interactive web applications. One of the most common uses of external data is integrating public APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) into websites. APIs provide a mechanism to pull in data from remote servers, enabling developers to display updated content without requiring the user to refresh the page.

For this project, we will create a responsive webpage that fetches weather data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap) and displays it dynamically. This will showcase the power of APIs in building real-time applications and highlight how APIs can enhance the user experience on websites.

API Integration Overview
APIs are essential in modern web development because they allow websites to retrieve information from external sources without the need for complex data handling on the server side. In our case, the API we will use is OpenWeatherMap, a popular service that provides current weather information from cities around the world.

Our goal is to build a webpage that:

Allows users to input a city name.
Fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Dynamically displays the weather data (such as temperature, weather description, and location) on the webpage.
We'll also ensure that the webpage is responsive and works well on various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.

Key Features of the Webpage
User Input:

The user can type a city name into an input field and click a button to fetch the weather data for that city.
Dynamic Data Fetching:

The page will use JavaScript (with the fetch() API) to asynchronously retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Weather Display:

Once the data is fetched, the weather details will be dynamically updated on the webpage (including temperature, weather description, and location).
Error Handling:

If the city name is incorrect or thereâ€™s an issue with the API, appropriate error messages will be displayed.
Responsive Design:

The page will adjust its layout and styling based on the screen size, ensuring a seamless experience for both desktop and mobile users.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the webpage.
CSS: For styling the webpage and making it responsive.
JavaScript: To interact with the OpenWeatherMap API, handle user input, and dynamically update the webpage content.
OpenWeatherMap API: A free API that provides weather information based on the user's input (city name).
